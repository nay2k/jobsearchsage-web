## Introduction

The Chat with Your Job Search Data feature provides a conversational AI interface where users can ask Sage about their job search progress and receive data-driven insights. Sage analyzes the user's pipeline data to answer natural language questions, provide strategic recommendations based on data patterns, and offer motivational insights that transform static data into actionable intelligence through conversation.
